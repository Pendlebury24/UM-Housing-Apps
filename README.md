# Background

University of Montana housing wanted an analysis conducted on students who did not show up at the start of the academic year and had applied to live on campus. This is an issue for them as it creates a waste of resources; for example, if 100 more students apply than there are available beds, the university needs to build more, but if 120 do not show up, then there is no need to build them, wasting employee time and resources. The analysis was conducted in R using student data from the University of Montana. 

One part of this project was creating a dashboard to view and analyze student applications to live in on-campus housing. This portion of the project, alongside more details on the analytics portion, can be viewed at ethanpendlebury.com/capstone

# Data

The data for this project is the University of Montana student housing applications from 2019 to 2023. The data was sourced from the university's StarRez housing management software. It contained 18 variables, including student demographic information and application data.
